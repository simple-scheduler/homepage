					<p>
						Have each employee create events appropriate for their own schedule
						and time required per appointment. We recommend enabling additional
						questions to collect contact information, then adding reminders, and
						disabling guests for single-person events. It is a good idea for
						employers to distribute a document containing a template, if they wish
						their employees to offer specific events. Calendly support is helpful
						in the event that you or your employees are struggling.
